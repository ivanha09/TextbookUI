# Microsoft: DEV318x - Understanding User Needs

## Observation

Observe what people's needs, desires, pain points, and contexts for use. Go where target users are. Observe their work practice or play practice. Ask the people you observe questions about their actions.

If your observations match your idea for a product then it's worth taking next steps.

When researching participants observe what they are doing and ask open ended questions. Take lots of notes. A two hour session should be able to produce 90 observations; one note per minute. This is for the data gathering phase. You can also take audio or video recordings to gather more information although people may get self-conscious.

Points to pay attention to:
* actions
* environment
* interactions
* intents
* objects and tools they use
* users they interact with
(AEIOU – Doblin Group 1991)

Process:
* Materials are gathered with 
  * Notes
  * Photos
  * videos
  * interviews
  * field observation
* Record observations under the appropriate headings
* Review and group observations to create higher level themes and patterns

## Interviews
Interviews should only be used as an alternative to user observation because the questions influences the output of the participant. Another reason they are not as reliable is because they the recall of the participant. Which can lead to people making up information rather than saying "I don't know".

Interviews can be used for documenting participants beliefs rather than their facts. They show what participants believe in response to your questions. What they believe can be useful towards creating something that appeals to them.

## Affinity Diagram

They help process the raw data from the participant observation.

Start by writing down a different observation on individual post-it notes.

After gathering all the data. Start grouping observations by patterns in the data.

Group the observations by "I" statements from the participants perspective.
“I find specific businesses by using a filtered search.”

Make sure all members of the group agree on the groupings.

## Word clouds

If the affinity diagram notes are input into a digital format another way to find patterns is to create word clouds that show a graph of the frequency of the terms.

## Task modelling
If the users are doing taskes with some type of process. It is possible to chart the process by each decision point which branches off dpending on the users choice. Breakdowns can be shown with different notation to show unsatisfied goals. Focus on the loops and breakdowns to find ways to make them more efficent.

### UML Activity diagrams are suitable for this type of modeling.
* flow of control
* Activity contains action, object, control
https://www.uml-diagrams.org/activity-diagrams.html
* Activity Partition - Can help seperate the activity with a common group. It could be an organizational unit, business actor.
* Activity Edge - are the connections between action nodes. (Update Order)--updated-->(Review Order)
* Object Flow Edge - represented with a box are the activity edges. (Updated Order)--[updated]-->(Review Order)
* Interrupting Edge - represented with lightening-bolt. Used to show flow in interrupted.
Business Process Model and Notation(BPMN) is too detailed for this stage.

### Customer Journey Maps
This map outlines the users initial intent through satisfaction of achieving that intent. Customer journey usually focuses on what the company is communicating the their customer at different stages. They also account for the customers emotion at each step. These are used to spot inefficiencies in a customers interaction with a company.

## Personas or Market Segments
When gathering information from different people. These people might group into different groups. By grouping these people and presenting this information designers and developers can create things for that group of people in mind.
