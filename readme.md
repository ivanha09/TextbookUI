When designing for the web it makes sense that the materials to teach it would be on it as well.
I wanted to start a resources for design of web and mobile.
I'm looking for more practical tips rather people could look quickly apply it to their own design. If you have any suggestions please create a pull request.
My hope is this list improve anyone eye for design and help people understand what makes one design better than another.
What designers are looking for and why they might suggest a change.
